        <blockquote>
        "We are the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No 
        Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war. Our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been 
        raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionares, and movie gods, and rockstars, but
        we won't. We're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off." -Tyler Durden from Fight Club

        <p>I think that this quote speaks volumes about the current generation in society. I am currently growing
		up in a generation that is glued to their screens and constantly browsing social media. It is getting
		more and more difficult to find people that are not looking at their phones. Granted, society will change 
		with the times, but as a society we need to do our best to make sure that technology is a tool and not the 
		center of our life. Thats what I take away from this quote.</p>
