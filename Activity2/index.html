        <p>I am a Junior at UNO, studying Management of Information Systems. My 
		hobbies are playing video games, watching tv and youtube, and spending time 
		with my girlfriend. I got into computers when I was a freshman in highschool
		because my dad bought me a laptop to do school work. Of course this laptop
		went through some abuse. I tried playing a wide multitude of video games on
		it, ranging from Skyrim to Diablo 3. All of which where graphically intense.
		I taught myself how to navigate effectively in computers through the modding
		of Oblivion and Skyrim. Constantly accessing game files to make mods work helped
		me understand where files in the laptop where located. Over time this usage
		of my laptop as a gaming laptop caused it to slow down. The system just couldn't
		handle anymore of my attempts to play video games are largely downscaled
		resolutions and poor graphics. I am sure the files in my first laptop where
		messed up because of how often I was editing game and computer files. My dad
		bought me a second laptop my Junior year and I was smart enough not to mess
		it up like my last laptop. But I still wanted to play video games on pc and so 
		I started saving my money to build my own desktop computer as of my Junior year
		in highschool. During the time I was saving up money and working I also was 
		researching all the necessary parts. Education about computer components became
		very important because I had to assemble the desktop myself and buy the correct
		components. This was a lot of fun and taught me the basics of building a computer
		while also giving me a tool that I am able to utilize for education and 
		entertainment purposes.

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>The highschool I went to was Milford Highschool, where I learned a variety of subjects.
		My first year of college was spent at Central Christian College of McPherson 
		Kansas. I intitially wanted to become a pilot and needed a way to afford it,
		Central Christian College was the only way I saw. They had a good financial
		aid work program that allowed me to work for them and pay on my tuition.
		Unfortunately, due to my lack of interest in flying as I progressed, I decided
		to transfer to a college where I could pursue a passion of mine.</p> 
		<p>Thusly, I transfered to UNO to get a degree in Information Technology. I 
		started with trying out courses and then settled on Cybersecurity. Due to the
		high amount of programming though, I decided to forgo Cybersecurity and recently
		opted to change my major to Management of Information Systems. I feel this step
		will be for the best because I love working with people but the coding side
		of computers is something I have immense difficulty wrapping my head around.</p>
